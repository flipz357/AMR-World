# Overview of free AMR tools and resources

An overview over available tools for doing all kinds of tasks on AMR graphs. Requirements to be included

- free usage
- small dependencies
- no parsing or generation (should be listed separately)

# AMR tools

## Graph processing, reading, writing

- [penman](https://github.com/goodmami/penman),  [ðŸ“œ](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.35/): library for reading, writing and manipulating graphs
                                                  
## AMR metrics & AMR-to-AMR alignment

- Smatch: structural graph similarity, one-to-one node alignment
- Smatch++: optimal/standardized Smatch and subgraph Smatch
- WWLK: Graded Weisfeiler Leman Kernel for AMR with glove embeddings, many-to-many alignment 

## AMR-to-text alignment

- WWLK-amr-text   | metric, text alignment  | Wasserstein amr-text alignment  
- [Leamr](https://github.com/ablodge/leamr), [ðŸ“œ](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.257/):  Statistical amr-text aligmemnt
