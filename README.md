# AMR World ðŸŒŽ: *Public* AMR tools and resources ðŸŽŠ

An overview of available tools and resources for AMR graphs. Requirements to be included are:

- Publicly available (main requirement)
- if it's a tool: easy to use (ideally)

Please file an issue or make a pull request if you want to make a suggestion for inclusion. There should be a link to a github-repository and (if available) a link to a related publication (ðŸ“œ). Note that work/papers on single parsers or generators should be listed separately, except if they are easy to use off-the-shelf.

Elements in each categorty are sorted alphabetically.

## AMR tools

If not mentioned otherwise, tools are all in Python.

### Parsing & generation

These are tools for generating AMRs from text (parsing), or generating text from AMR (generation). 

- [amrlib](https://github.com/bjascob/amrlib): Many pre-trained (English) models for parsing and generation.

### Annotation and Visualization

(Usually) GUI-based tools for creating, saving, and showing AMRs

### Metrics & Graph alignment

#### Structure matching 

The following are graph metrics that compare graphs structurally (i.e., they don't use embeddings etc.).

#### Structure and content matching

These are "advanced" metrics that use embeddings or other features, for finer graph meaning similarity (e.g., structures like `kitten` vs. `cat` vs. possibly `cat :mod young`, etc.).

#### Graph alignment

These are methods for finding out which parts of two AMRs relate to eath other. Most are based on a side-product from computing a metric.

- Align nodes: Smatch, S2match, XSmatch
- Align broader structures: WWLK

### Graph-to-text alignment

These are methods for finding out which parts of two AMRs relate to which parts of a sentence.

## AMR data and miscelanea

### Main English Sembanks

They  have their own section. The public datasets, like Little Prince, are hosted in this github, since the link to the main webpage is currently broken. 

Please find the major public manual AMR annotations in [this directory](https://github.com/flipz357/AMR-World/tree/main/data/reference_amrs).
