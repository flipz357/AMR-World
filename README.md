# AMR World ðŸŒŽ: *Public* AMR tools and resources ðŸŽŠ

An overview of available tools and resources for AMR graphs. Requirements to be included are:

- Publicly available (main requirement)
- If it's a tool: easy to use (ideally)

Please file an issue or make a pull request if you want to make a suggestion for inclusion. There should be a link to a github-repository and (if available) a link to a related publication (ðŸ“œ). Note that work/papers on single parsers or generators should be listed separately, except if they are easy to use off-the-shelf.

### Metrics and Evaluation

#### Structure matching 

The following are graph metrics that compare graphs structurally (i.e., they don't use embeddings etc.).

#### Structure and content matching

These are "advanced" metrics that use embeddings or other features, for finer graph meaning similarity (e.g., structures like `kitten` vs. `cat` vs. possibly `cat :mod young`, etc.).
