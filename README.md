# AMR World ðŸŒŽ: *free* AMR tools and resources ðŸŽŠ

An overview of available tools and resources for AMR graphs. Requirements to be included are:

- free usage (main requirement)
- easy to use (ideally)

Please file an issue or make a pull request if you want to make a suggestion for inclusion. There should be a link to a github-repository and (if available) a link to a related publication (ðŸ“œ). Note that work/papers on single parsers or generators should be listed separately, except if they are easy to use off-the-shelf.

Elements are sorted alphabetically.

## AMR tools

If not mentioned otherwise, tools are all in Python.

### Parsing & generation

These are tools for generating AMRs from text (parsing), or generating text from AMR (generation).

- [amrlib](https://github.com/bjascob/amrlib): Many pre-trained (English) models for parsing and generation.

### Graph reading, writing

These are tools for reading, writing and handling AMR graphs.

- [amr-utils](https://github.com/ablodge/amr-utils): read, write, modify graphs
- [penman](https://github.com/goodmami/penman),  [ðŸ“œ](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.35/): read, write, modify graphs

### Metrics & Graph alignment

#### Structure matching 

The following are graph metrics that compare meaning graphs structurally (i.e., they don't use embeddings etc.). 

- [Ancast](https://github.com/sxndqc/ancast), [ðŸ“œ](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.94/): Approximates Smatch, more efficient than Smatch
- [Sema](https://github.com/rafaelanchieta/sema), [ðŸ“œ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12069): triple match heuristic, fast
- [SemBleu](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/sembleu), [ðŸ“œ](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1446/): path extraction heuristic, fast
- [Smatch](https://github.com/snowblink14/smatch), [ðŸ“œ](https://aclanthology.org/P13-2131/): triple match, heuristic solver

#### Structure and content matching

These are metrics that use embeddings or other features, for finer graph meaning similarity (e.g., structures like `kitten` vs. `cat` vs. possibly `cat :mod young`, etc.).

#### Graph alignment

These are methods for finding out which parts of two AMRs relate to eath other. Most are based on a side-product from computing a metric.

- Align nodes: Smatch, S2match, XSmatch
- Align broader structures: WWLK

### Graph-to-text alignment

These are methods for finding out which parts of two AMRs relate to which parts of a sentence.

## AMR resources

### Sembanks: English

English Sembanks contain English texts and their AMR graphs.

- [Bio AMR](https://amr.isi.edu/download/2018-01-25/amr-release-bio-v3.0.txt): 6952 AMR annotated sentences from bio-medical domain

The largest English AMR sembanks, as well as translations of many of their sentences into other languages, are unfortunately not open datasets (they are licensed through the Linguistic Data Consortium).

### Sembanks: Other languages

Non-English Sembanks contain Non-English texts and their AMR graphs.
