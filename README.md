# Overview of free AMR tools and resources

An overview of available tools for doing all kinds of tasks on AMR graphs. Requirements to be included

- free usage
- small dependencies (ideally)
- no parsing or generation (should be listed separately)

Please file an issue or make a pull request if you want to make a suggestion for inclusion.
